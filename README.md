# Apply-PCA-to-AR-face-datasets

(a) Using PCA to project the data into a space of dimensionality d = 1, 5, 9. To do so, use session 1 as training set to compute eigenvectors and use session 2 as testing images.
Then, show the following results:

(i) For each value of d, show the d eigenfaces, and

(ii) For each subject, randomly select an image from its test set, and then display the respective approximation using the d eigenfaces (for each value of d).




(b) With the learned projections by PCA for d = 1, 5, 9, perform face recognition via nearest neighbor search for all test images, and report their error rate.
